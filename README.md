# Should I Follow?

http://www.shouldifollow.com

When determining to follow someone on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) it's often difficult to accurately assess how much they'll add to your stream. Looking at their recent activity on Twitter works in many cases, but for users with many replies and/or retweets it gets much more difficult to see at a glance how many tweets this person would actually add to your stream.

ShouldIFollow takes the guesswork out by showing some simple metrics of their average activity over both the last week and last month:

1. Tweets per day

2. ReTweets per day (since retweets can be turned off for individual people)

3. Tweets and ReTweets per day (convenience for people really bad at math)

4. Total per day (since they joined Twitter, and includes replies)

5. Timing of their tweets broken down by hour (based on last 200 tweets)
