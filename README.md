# Should I Follow?

http://www.shouldifollow.com

When determining to follow someone on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) it's often difficult to accurately assess how much 
"noise" they generate. Looking at their recent activity on Twitter is fine in many cases, but for users
with many replies it gets much more difficult to see how many tweets this person would add to your stream each
day.

ShouldIFollow takes the guesswork out by showing some simple metrics of their activity over the last week:

1. Tweets per day

2. ReTweets per day (retweets can be turned off for individual people)

3. Tweets and ReTweets per day (convenience for people really bad at math)

4. Total per day (since they joined Twitter, and includes replies)
