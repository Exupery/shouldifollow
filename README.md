http://www.shouldifollow.com

When considering following someone on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) it's often difficult to accurately assess how much they'll add to your stream. [ShouldIFollow](http://www.shouldifollow.com) takes the guesswork out by showing some metrics of their average activity. 

Metrics are shown for the past week and the past month unless otherwise noted:

* Tweets per day
* Retweets per day
* Combined (tweets and retweets) per day
* Most used hashtag
* Number of hashtags used
* Total (tweets, retweets, and replies) per day (_since they joined Twitter_)
* Timing of their tweets broken down by hour (_based on last 200 tweets_)
